# üö¶ Traffic Sign Classification

This project focuses on classifying traffic signs using deep learning techniques. It demonstrates how computer vision and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be applied to real-world problems such as autonomous driving and road safety systems.

## üéØ Objective

- Train a model to accurately classify traffic signs into their respective categories.
- Utilize deep learning and image processing techniques to build an end-to-end classification system.
- Evaluate the model's performance and interpret its predictions.

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **TensorFlow / Keras** ‚Äì Deep learning framework
- **OpenCV** ‚Äì Image preprocessing
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** ‚Äì Visualization
- **NumPy / Pandas** ‚Äì Data handling
- **Jupyter Notebook** ‚Äì Development and testing

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset

The project uses a traffic sign dataset containing images of various road signs labeled by class. Each image is:
- Labeled with the sign category (e.g., speed limit, yield, stop).
- Preprocessed and resized for uniform input to the neural network.
